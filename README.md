I'm the co-author of [Learning API Styles](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-API-Styles-Understanding-Trade-Offs/dp/1098153995) published by [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-api-styles/9781098153984/). I do engineering for a living and programming for fun. I work with people and technology. In short, I'm immersed in software engineering. What about you? What's your Kung-Foo?
