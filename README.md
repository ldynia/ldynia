#### Live long and Pull Request

I’m the author of [learningapistyles.com][1] published by [O'Reilly][2], and I bridge people with technology by crossing the chasms of software engineering.
I translate business needs into software requirements, helping to architect, design, implement, and operate systems securly.
I’m also an independent consultant, though I prefer the term “gun for hire”. But, don’t worry, the gun is pointed at software problems, and the bullets are meant for troubleshooting.
